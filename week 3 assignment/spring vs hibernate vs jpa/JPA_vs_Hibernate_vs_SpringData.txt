# Difference between JPA, Hibernate, Spring Data JPA

- **JPA** is a specification (standard).
  - Needs manual EntityManager.
  - You control transactions, persistence manually.

- **Hibernate** is an implementation of JPA.
  - Offers more advanced features like caching, native queries.
  - Uses Session instead of EntityManager.

- **Spring Data JPA** is a framework built on top of JPA.
  - Auto-generates repositories (CRUD) using interfaces.
  - Less boilerplate, integrates with Spring Boot easily.
